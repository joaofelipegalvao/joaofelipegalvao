## 👋 About Me

I'm a Systems Analysis and Development student (4th semester - Estácio) and a backend developer passionate about turning learning into real code. My journey is focused on building open-source projects that solve real problems, applying software engineering best practices from the ground up.

I have hands-on experience in **Backend Development** with Java and Spring Boot, **Relational and NoSQL Databases**, **Automation and Integrations** via scripts and REST APIs, and **E-Commerce Environments**, where I dealt with production systems, bug fixing, and payment API integrations.

I believe in the power of shared knowledge: clean code, clear documentation, and solutions that can be useful to other developers. I'm always open to collaborations and discussions about software architecture and best practices.

## 🎯 Current Focus

* ☕ **Java & Spring Boot**: REST APIs, design patterns, scalable architectures, JWT security.
* 🦀 **Rust**: Performant CLI tools, ownership, lifetimes, and introduction to web frameworks (Actix/Axum).
* 🗄️ **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MongoDB — modeling, optimized queries, and indexes.
* 🔄 **Automation**: Bash scripts, N8N workflows, and system integrations via REST APIs.
* 🐳 **Docker & Cloud**: Containerizing applications and deploying on platforms like Render and Railway.
* 🧪 **Testing**: JUnit, Mockito, TDD, and static code analysis.
* 📚 **Architecture**: SOLID, MVC, Repository patterns, microservices, and clean architectures.

📖 Currently deepening: Spring Security, async/await in Rust, and microservices communication.
